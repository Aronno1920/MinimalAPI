<h2>What is Minimal API</h2>
<p>Minimal APIs were introduced in .NET 6 as a way to simplify the process of creating small, focused APIs. They are designed to reduce the amount of boilerplate code required to set up an API and make the development process more streamlined. You define your routes, endpoints, and handlers in a more concise manner using the MapGet, MapPost, and similar methods.</p>

<h2>Advantages:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Minimal APIs are concise and require less code compared to traditional REST APIs.</li>
  <li>They are suitable for simple scenarios where you need to quickly create an API without a lot of complex configuration.</li>
  <li>Routing and handling endpoints are done using lambdas, making it easier to understand the flow of the API.</li>
  <li>Minimal APIs are a great choice for simple scenarios where you want to quickly expose a few endpoints without dealing with the complexities of traditional routing and middleware setup.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Disadvantages:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Minimal APIs might not be the best choice for complex APIs with a large number of endpoints and intricate routing requirements.</li>
  <li>They might not provide the same level of customization and control as traditional REST APIs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Endpoint Attributes: </h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>WithName:</strong> Specifies the name of the endpoint. This can be helpful for generating documentation or identifying endpoints programmatically.</li>
  <li><strong>Produces:</strong> Specifies the content types that the endpoint can produce as responses. This attribute is used to indicate the types of data that the client can expect to receive from the server.</li>
  <li><strong>Accepts:</strong> Specifies the content types that the endpoint can accept in requests. This attribute is used to indicate the types of data that the client can send to the server.</li>
</ul>
